# compare cost functions
# variance, match target, generic quadratic cost, cost
# max entropy, normalized deviation

# evaluation: when within ...% of equilibrium?

# rand: improvement for minimizing std deviation, only when 1'*A*1~0 and a'*A*a>>0, a'*1=0 (A p.s.d. not sufficient), equal B can improve convergence (E5.1)
# rand: no noticeable difference in convergence between non-convex/convex problems.
# rand: convergence behaviour of G/GmA and normalized/un-normalized previous aggregates similar to min variance
