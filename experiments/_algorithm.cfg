# compare algorithms (bicycle and energy datasets)
# MinVarGmA (+-LS), Greedy (add afterwards as baseline), Dynamic Programming (TODO), Ants (TODO), Reinforcement learning (TODO)
# compare with Opt on small size
# #iterations to beat Greedy?
# per algorithm: compare different configurations (MinVar, Ants, Reinforcement learning?)

# - local search (only accept changes by a child, if cost decreased)
# - gradually increasing number of plans to avoid slow convergence with sparse data
