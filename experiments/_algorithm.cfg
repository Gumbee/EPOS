# compare algorithms (bicycle and energy datasets)
# MinVarGmA (+-LS), Greedy (add afterwards as baseline), Dynamic Programming (TODO), Ants (TODO), Reinforcement learning (TODO)
# compare with Opt on small size
# per algorithm: compare different configurations (MinVar, Ants, Reinforcement learning?)
